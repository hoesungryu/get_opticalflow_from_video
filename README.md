# get_opticalflow_from_video

This python code was created to extract the `optical-flow` from the video. This implementation is based on the `Farneback's algorithm`.

## Usage
With the main code, you can get a numpy file for each video. 
> python main.py --source_path <video folder path> --target_path <save folder path> --target_video_size <convert size of video>

## Visualization of Optical-flow 
> TODO!!
